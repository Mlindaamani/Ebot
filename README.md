This is the simple e-commerce web app named Ebot built using PHP OOP concept.
I have used bootstrap 5 to create my app UI.
This project utilize some advanced software development concepts such dependency injection ðŸ’‰.
It is kind of MVC but using only vanilla php, mysql, bootstrap 5, and custom css.
I have not handled payment integration such as  using stripe since this project is here to help my fellow computer science students like me completing our first year at universities.
In this simple project you will have a chance to learn good coding practices such as separation of concerns, using function to perform different tasks and keeping functions as simple as possible performing only a single task.
